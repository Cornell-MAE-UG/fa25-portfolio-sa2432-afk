Designing the Rigid Bar as a Beam: For HW 12 the bar was redesigned as a beam; thus, the maximum deflection was calculated, and the design constraints required a small deflection with a low cross sectional area (most mass efficient). Therefore, I designed a beam of steel with a 27.25 mm diameter (the beam is cylindrical with a circular cross section).
