Designing the Rigid Bar: As a continuation of my HW 5 assignment, here is an image detailing my calculations and parameters when designing the rigid beam. To find the maximum amount of weight the system can support, I drew a free body diagram constituting only pin A and the bar. In this FBD, I included the horizontal and vertical reaction forces at A, the weight of the load, and the force applied by the actuator (this force has a magnitude of 35 kN). By taking the moments about A, I came up with an equation for the weight, and using python I was able to find the maximum values of these measurements and the weight (ie. determining constraints for the length and change in height, as well as choosing a length dimension for the actuator and bar). Thus, I was able to find that the maximum weight is 31.0 kN and the maximum length is 1.3 meters or 130 cm.

Designing the Rigid Bar as a Beam: For HW 12 the bar was redesigned as a beam; thus, the maximum deflection was calculated, and the design constraints required a small deflection with a low cross sectional area (most mass efficient). Therefore, I designed a beam of steel with a 27.25 mm diameter (the beam is cylindrical with a circular cross section). The image of this beam design is underneath my previous calculations.
