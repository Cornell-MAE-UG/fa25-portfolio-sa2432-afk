My name is Samiha Anjum, and I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University intending to major in Biomedical Engineering. My current experience working in a biomedical engineering lab and my passion for the biological sciences has motivated me to pursue this field; I hope to pursue a career in the biotech industry, merging technical skills with scientific knowledge to design innovative therapies.
